##  Identifying conditional probability measures

This is the set of codes used for the numerical computations in Bortz, Byrne and Mirzaev (2016), where we investigate the inverse problem of identifying a conditional probability measure in measure-dependent evolution equations arising in size-structured population modeling. We apply the theory to a particular PDE model that arises in the study of population dynamics for flocculating bacterial aggregates in suspension, and provide numerical evidence for the utility of the approach.


## Dependencies
The program is written purely in Python 2.7. It depends on some famous libraries: *SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, multiprocessing, etc*.
All the dependencies can be solved by installing *Anaconda* software package. Installation instructions can be found at
